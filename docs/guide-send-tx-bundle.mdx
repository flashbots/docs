title: Sending Tx and Bundles
---

Flashbots provides a variety of methods for submitting transactions and bundles. This guide is designed to help you understand these options and select the one that best fits your needs.

## Understanding Relay and RPC Endpoints

Flashbots offers two primary JSON-RPC endpoints on Ethereum Mainnet: `rpc.flashbots.net` and `relay.flashbots.net`.

### `rpc.flashbots.net` - For Retail Users
- **Purpose**: Designed specifically for retail users as a drop-in RPC replacement in their wallet.
- **Features**: Provides MEV protection and MEV refunds for eligible transactions. Support all the regular [Ethereum JSON RPC methods](https://docs.infura.io/networks/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/) but not [Flashbots specific JSON RPC
methods](flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint).
- **Note**: Transactions are submitted through `eth_sendRawTransaction` to fit wallet RPC interface. Underneath, the endpoint uses `relay.flashbots.net` to submit transactions.

### `relay.flashbots.net` - For Advanced Users
- **Purpose**: Designed for advanced users, including searchers, applications, and Telegram bots. It accepts both transactions and bundles.
- **Features**: Support all [Flashbots specific JSON RPC methods](flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint). Does not support regular [Ethereum JSON RPC methods](https://docs.infura.io/networks/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/).
- **Recommendation**: Ideal for activities beyond simple transaction submissions via wallets.

## Choosing the Right JSON-RPC Method

With `relay.flashbots.net` identified as the go-to for advanced operations, the choice of JSON-RPC methods is as follows:

- **For Single Transactions**: Use `eth_sendPrivateTransaction`.
- **For Bundles of Transactions**:
  - **Use**: `mev_sendBundle` for more flexibility and power, like leveraging the [new bundle format](flashbots-mev-share/searchers/understanding-bundles) and [MEV-Share](flashbots-mev-share/introduction).
  - **Use**: `eth_sendBundle` if you want something simple and quick! The OG way of sending bundles.
  - Both bundle APIs support [multiplexing to multiple builders](flashbots-auction/advanced/multiplexing).

## Rate Limits

In order to protect our services from abuse we have rate limits on the number of requests that can be made.

- [RPC rate limits for retail user transactions sent to](flashbots-protect/ratelimiting) `rpc.flashbots.net`
- [Relay rate limits for advanced user bundles sent to](flashbots-mev-share/searchers/ratelimiting) `relay.flashbots.net`
