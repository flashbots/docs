title: Rate Limits
---

In order to protect our services from abuse we have rate limits on the number of requests that can be made. Currently, the rate limits are set as follows.

## `relay.flashbots.net` - Bundles

| Method              | Limit              |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `eth_sendBundle`    | 1800 / IP / 1 min  |
| `mev_sendBundle`    | 1800 / IP / 1 min  |
| `eth_cancelBundle`  | 600 / IP / 1 min   |
| `mev_simBundle`     | 300 / IP / 1 min   |
| `eth_callBundle`    | 300 / IP / 1 min   |
| All others          | 120 / IP / 1 min   |

Note that this is _requests_ and not _transactions_ submitted per second. There is no limitation on the number of transactions in a request.

RPC rate limits for retail user transactions sent to `rpc.flashbots.net` [can be found here](../../flashbots-protect/ratelimiting).
