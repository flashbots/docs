title: Sending Bundles

Bundles on MEV-Share are conceptually the same as bundles on MEV-Boost; they are an ordered array of transactions; but their structure is a bit different. There are several new parameters which control the privacy of bundles, and there's also a new endpoint to send bundles: [`mev_sendBundle`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share/blob/main/specs/mev_sendBundle.md).

Check out the spec to see how bundles on MEV-Share are structured:

<SendBundleRpc />

This is the generic bundle structure used in MEV-Share, which enables several exciting new features:

* **Bundle Composition** -- use other searchers' bundles in your bundles.
* **Pre-inclusion Predicates** -- specify strict context in which your bundles can be considered by builders.
* **Post-inclusion Predicates** -- specify payment requirements for builders to seal a block containing your bundle.
* **Granular Privacy** -- specify data to share about your bundles to earn kickbacks on top of searching profits, and choose your preferred builders.

While the new bundle spec may look complex, a bundle can be sent with default parameters using a client library, which actually looks quite similar to sending bundles on mev-boost.

```typescript
import Matchmaker, { BundleParams } from '@flashbots/matchmaker-ts'

const matchmaker = Matchmaker.useEthereumMainnet(authSigner)

// ...

const bundle = [
    {hash: PENDING_TX.hash},
    {tx: await wallet.signTransaction(BACKRUN), canRevert: false},
]

const params: BundleParams = {
    inclusion: {
        block: targetBlock,
        // target several blocks with `maxBlock`
        maxBlock: targetBlock + ADDL_TARGET_BLOCKS,
    },
    body: bundle,
}
```

See [matchmaker-ts](https://github.com/flashbots/matchmaker-ts/blob/main/src/examples/sendBackrunBundle.ts) for a working example.

The params not included in the previous example can be used to configure more advanced conditions for your bundle's execution and the MEV kickbacks you earn.

**Share bundle data**

<TabItem value="ts" label="matchmaker-ts">

```typescript
const params: BundleParams = {
    inclusion: {
        block: targetBlock,
    },
    body: BUNDLE,
    privacy: {
        hints: ["calldata", "logs"],
    },
}
```

**Nest bundles (be a matchmaker)**

<TabItem value="ts" label="matchmaker-ts">

```typescript
const params: BundleParams = {
    inclusion: {
        block: targetBlock,

    body: {
        {hash: PENDING_TX_HASH},
        {bundle: {
            inclusion: {...},
            body: {...},
            privacy: {...},
            validity: {...},
