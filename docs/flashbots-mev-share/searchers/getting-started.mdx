To start searching on MEV-Share, you will first need to connect to a MEV-Share Node. As a reminder, the MEV-Share Node is responsible for receiving transactions and bundles from users, and selectively sharing information ("hints") about them with searchers. When a searcher wants to include a transaction in their bundle, they use that transaction's hash. The MEV-Share Node replaces it with the original transaction before sending the bundle to a block builder.

## Connect to MEV-Share Node

Flashbots operates an MEV-Share Node on the Ethereum mainnet. This Node provides endpoints for user transactions and searcher bundles. Additionally, it offers an SSE event stream endpoint, broadcasting pending events/transactions to searchers.

The simplest way to connect to the Flashbots MEV-Share Node is to use a [client library](/flashbots-auction/searchers/libraries/mev-share-clients). For this guide, we'll refer to [mev-share-client-ts](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share-client-ts).

<TabItem value="ts" label="mev-share-client-ts">

*Add library to your project:*

```sh
yarn add @flashbots/mev-share-client
```

*Use the following code to import the library* (Replace ALL_CAPS placeholders with your data):
```typescript
import { Wallet, JsonRpcProvider } from "ethers"
import MevShareClient, {
    BundleParams,
    HintPreferences,
    IPendingBundle,
    IPendingTransaction,
    TransactionOptions
} from "@flashbots/mev-share-client"

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL)
const authSigner = new Wallet(FB_REPUTATION_PRIVATE_KEY, provider)
const mevShareClient = MevShareClient.useEthereumMainnet(authSigner)
```

_Connecting to Goerli:_

```typescript
const mevShareClient = MevShareClient.useEthereumGoerli(authSigner)
```

*Advanced setup* (for developers):

```typescript
// connect to MEV-Share on mainnet
const mevShareClient = new MevShareClient(authSigner, {
    name: "mainnet",
    chainId: 1,
    streamUrl: "https://mev-share.flashbots.net",
    apiUrl: "https://relay.flashbots.net",
})
```

Further documentation on the client library can be found in the [mev-share-client-ts](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share-client-ts).

### A note on other languages

If you're coding in a language that doesn't yet have a MEV-Share Node client library, you can send transactions and bundles directly with the [JSON-RPC endpoint](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint). To listen for transactions, all you need is an HTTP client. More details on that in the [Event Stream](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/event-stream) page.

Now you should be connected to the Flashbots MEV-Share Node. Continue reading on the next page to learn how to [listen for hints](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/event-stream) about pending transactions shared by the MEV-Share Node.

:::note A note for experienced searchers getting acquainted with MEV-Share

Searching on MEV-Share is different from searching on the mempool in that only certain parts of a transaction are shared with searchers. In the mempool, we can see all parts of a transaction, such as its calldata or who the transaction is from. But on MEV-Share, a transaction might only reveal its function selector, making a traditional arbitrage calculation infeasible.

There are three primary strategies for searching on MEV-Share:
* Probabilistically: send many bundles that probabilistically backrun MEV-Share orderflow.
* On-chain: perform more of your searching on-chain instead of off-chain.
* Existing: only search on transactions which share all the information you need.

To maximally leverage MEV-Share searchers will need to employ new strategies.
