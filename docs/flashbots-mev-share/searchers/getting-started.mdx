To start searching on MEV-Share, you will first need to connect to a MEV-Share Node. As a reminder, the MEV-Share Node is responsible for receiving transactions and bundles from users, and selectively sharing information ("hints") about them with searchers. When a searcher wants to include a transaction in their bundle, they use that transaction's hash. The MEV-Share Node replaces it with the original transaction before sending the bundle to a block builder.

## Connect to MEV-Share Node

Flashbots runs a MEV-Share Node on Ethereum mainnet. The MEV-Share Node has endpoints to receive transactions and bundles, as well as an SSE event stream endpoint which dispatches pending events/transactions to searchers.

The simplest way to connect to the Flashbots MEV-Share Node is to use a [client library](/flashbots-auction/searchers/libraries/mev-share-clients). For this guide, we'll refer to [mev-share-client-ts](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share-client-ts).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ts" label="mev-share-client-ts">

_Add library to your project:_

```sh
yarn add @flashbots/mev-share-client
```

_Import library code (note `ALL_CAPS` variables are placeholders; replace with your own data):_

```typescript
import { Wallet, JsonRpcProvider } from "ethers"
import MevShareClient, {
    ShareBundleParams,
    PendingShareTransaction,
    ShareTransactionOptions
} from "@flashbots/mev-share-client"

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL)
const authSigner = new Wallet(FB_REPUTATION_PRIVATE_KEY, provider)
const mevShareClient = MevShareClient.useEthereumMainnet(authSigner)
```

_Connecting to Goerli:_

```typescript
const mevShareClient = MevShareClient.useEthereumGoerli(authSigner)
```

_Custom params (for developers):_

```typescript
// connect to MEV-Share on mainnet
const mevShareClient = new MevShareClient(authSigner, {
    name: "mainnet",
    chainId: 1,
    streamUrl: "https://mev-share.flashbots.net",
    apiUrl: "https://relay.flashbots.net",
})
```

See the documentation in the [mev-share-client-ts](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share-client-ts) repo to learn more.

### note A note on other languages

If you're coding in a language that doesn't yet have a MEV-Share Node client library, you can send transactions & bundles directly with the [JSON-RPC endpoint](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint). To listen for transactions, all you need is an HTTP client. More details on that in the [Event Stream](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/event-stream) page.

Now you should be connected to the Flashbots MEV-Share Node. Continue reading on the next page to learn how to [listen for hints](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/event-stream) about pending transactions shared by the MEV-Share Node.

:::note A note for experienced searchers getting acquainted with MEV-Share

Searching on MEV-Share is different from searching on the mempool in that only certain parts of a transaction are shared with searchers. On the mempool, we can see all parts of a transaction, such as calldata and logs. But on MEV-Share, a transaction might only reveal its function selector, making a traditional arbitrage calculation infeasible (though this is not necessarily the common case).

That being said, existing strategies can still be employed. Users of MEV-Share have the option to share whichever parts of the transaction they deem appropriate, so strategies which use calldata and/or logs as input are still viable.

To maximally leverage the orderflow on MEV-Share, new searching strategies will have to be implemented to profitably include these transactions in your bundles. More specifically, you may have to reason about markets and/or blockchain state separately from the intra-block context of users' transactions, and leveraging data gleaned from mev-share transactions, probabilistically estimate the parameters of your MEV extraction strategy. A range of probable outcomes may be targeted in parallel, but this must be done efficiently, so as to maintain priority in the MEV-Share Node's priority queues.
