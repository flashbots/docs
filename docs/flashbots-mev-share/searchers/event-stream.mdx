title: Event Stream

Events on MEV-Share are distributed via an SSE endpoint. Searchers listen to this endpoint to receive a stream of new events, which contain data they can use in their bundles. Currently, the events refer to Ethereum transactions.

## Quickstart

Subscribe to the stream by making an HTTP GET request on the stream endpoint. The [matchmaker-ts](https://npmjs.com/@flashbots/matchmaker-ts) library implements this as an asynchronous event handler.

<TabItem value="ts" label="matchmaker-ts">

```typescript
import Matchmaker, { IMatchmakerEvent, StreamEvent } from '@flashbots/matchmaker-ts'

const matchmaker = Matchmaker.useEthereumMainnet(authSigner)

const eventHandler = matchmaker.on(StreamEvent.Transaction, (tx: IMatchmakerEvent) => {
    /*
    Do something with the event data here.
    */
})

// call before your program terminates:
eventHandler.close()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sh" label="curl">

```sh
curl https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net
```

This will block until terminated manually (CTRL-C).

_Response:_

```sh
:ping

data: {"hash":"0xc7dc06c994400830054ab815732d91275bc1241f9be62b62b687b7882f19b8d4","logs":null,"txs":[{"to":"0x0000c335bc9d5d1af0402cad63fa7f258363d71a","functionSelector":"0x696d2073","callData":"0x696d20736861726969696969696e67"}]}
```

:::info Event Data

Events currently represent pending transactions, but eventually may be expanded to support other event types. For this reason we refer to this endpoint as an _event stream_, rather than a _transaction stream_.

### Event Stream Endpoints

| Network | URL |
|-|-|
| Mainnet | https://mev-share.flashbots.net |
| Goerli | https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net |

The endpoint sends an event with the message `:ping` every 15 seconds if no other messages were sent in the last 15 seconds.

## Event Scheme

Events dispatched via the SSE endpoint are JSON-encoded objects that adhere to the following scheme:

<StreamEvent />

Note that each of these properties are optional; if a field is not present, it means that the transaction sender chose not to share that information.
