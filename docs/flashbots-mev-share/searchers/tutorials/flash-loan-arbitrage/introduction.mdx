# Introduction

In this guide, we show you how to run an atomic arbitrage bot that uses flash loans. Flash loans allow you to borrow vast amounts of capital, which we'll use to pay for arbitrage trades. If you make a profit, then you pay back the loan and keep what's left over. If you don't, then the transaction simply reverts. Thanks to Flashbots, we don't pay for reverted transactions; we only have to pay gas for successful transactions. In sum, this is an ultra-low-risk strategy that requires very little upfront capital.

We'll start with a [turnkey bot](https://github.com/flashbots/simple-blind-arbitrage) you can run yourself. For a detailed description of how it works, see the next page.
