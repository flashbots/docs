We hope you found this guide useful! This is only the first of several, in which we'll show you more exciting ways to use MEV-Share, and all its unique features. In future guides, we'll talk about how to write more advanced bots that extract MEV opportunities, how to maximize your profits by using hints, and cover advanced features and techniques that are made possible by MEV-Share.

While we work on more guides, we encourage you to check out our other resources on MEV-Share, and get in touch with us on Discord, on our Forum, or @ one of us on Twitter!
