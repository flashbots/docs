Bundles on MEV-Share are conceptually the same as bundles on MEV-Boost: they are an ordered array of transactions that execute atomically. However, their structure is a bit different. MEV-Share bundles use a new method called [`mev_sendBundle`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share/blob/main/specs/bundles/v0.1.md) which has additional fields used to specify their `privacy` and other guarantees.

## Bundle Definition

MEV-Share Bundles have the following structure:

<SendBundleRpc />

This is the generic bundle structure used in MEV-Share. This comprehensive specification enables several exciting features, outlined in the next section.

<Hints />

## Use Cases

With an array of parameters at your disposal, there are many ways to build bundles on MEV-Share. The following sections describe new features and use cases that arise from the bundle definition.

### Bundle Composition

- Share data from your bundles with other searchers to earn MEV refunds.
- Use other searchers' bundles in your own bundles to execute a more profitable strategy.

Bundle composition is enabled by the `privacy` parameter in `mev_sendBundle`.

One example that works well with bundle composition is a liquidation bot. Liquidations often cause a price shift, leaving MEV on the table which can be captured by arbitrage with a backrun bundle. If you run a liquidation bot, you can earn more MEV by sending your bundles to MEV-Share with the `tx_hash` hint enabled, which will allow other searchers to backrun your bundle.

An example would look something like this:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ts" label="mev-share-client-ts">

```typescript
const params: BundleParams = {
    inclusion: {
        block: 17539448,
        maxBlock: 17539458
    },
    body: [
        {tx: "0x02...", canRevert: false},
        {tx: "0x02...", canRevert: false},
    ],
    privacy: {
        hints: {
            txHash: true,
        },
    },
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Specifying the `tx_hash` hint in your bundle shares the hashes of your bundle's transactions with searchers on MEV-Share, which is what allows them to backrun your bundle. When they do this, you earn a cut of the profit!

You may also try experimenting with other hints to give searchers more data with which to formulate a backrun. Sharing more data will lower your privacy, but will make your bundle easier to backrun, and increase the likelihood of your bundles earning extra MEV.

:::caution only original transactions are supported

Bundles that set the `privacy` parameter can only contain original signed transactions in the `body` parameter. Bundles using transactions specified by `{hash}` are not allowed to use the privacy parameter (full bundle privacy is maintained in this case). Allowing such bundles to share data using the `privacy` parameter would compromise the privacy guarantees of user transactions.

### Pre-inclusion Predicates

- Specify a strict range of blocks to target.
- Predicate is evaluated before the builder considers the bundle for inclusion in a block.

See [inclusion](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/understanding-bundles#bundle-definition) for relevant parameters.

### Post-inclusion Predicates

- Set guaranteed refund for inclusion of bundle in a block.
- Specify refund per-transaction in a bundle.
- Send refund to any desired account.

See [validity](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/understanding-bundles#bundle-definition) for relevant parameters.

### Granular Privacy

- Specify data to share about your bundles to earn refund on top of searching profits.
- Choose your preferred builder(s), and send them your orderflow exclusively.

Now that we know all the different ways in which we can send and share bundles, we're finally ready to [send a bundle](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/sending-bundles).
