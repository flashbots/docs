Bundles on MEV-Share are conceptually the same as bundles on MEV-Boost; they are an ordered array of transactions; but their structure is a bit different. There are several new parameters which control the privacy of bundles, and there's also a new endpoint to send bundles: [`mev_sendBundle`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share/blob/main/specs/mev_sendBundle.md).

## Bundle Definition

MEV-Share Bundles have the following structure:

<SendBundleRpc />

This is the generic bundle structure used in MEV-Share. This comprehensive specification enables several exciting features, outlined in the next section.

## Use Cases

With `arrays` of parameters at your disposal, there are many ways to build bundles on MEV-Share. The following sections describe new features and use cases that arise from the bundle definition.

### Bundle Composition

- Share data from your bundles with other searchers to earn MEV kickbacks.
- Specify locations in your bundle where searchers are allowed to insert transactions to earn even more kickbacks.
- Use other searchers' bundles in your own bundles to execute a more profitable strategy.

### Pre-inclusion Predicates

- Specify a strict range of blocks to target.
- Predicate is evaluated before the builder considers the bundle for inclusion in a block.

See [inclusion](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/understanding-bundles#bundle-definition) for relevant parameters.

### Post-inclusion Predicates

- Set guaranteed kickback for inclusion of bundle in a block.
- Specify kickbacks per-transaction in a bundle.
- Send kickbacks to any desired account.

See [validity](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/understanding-bundles#bundle-definition) for relevant parameters.

### Granular Privacy

- Specify data to share about your bundles to earn kickbacks on top of searching profits.
- Choose your preferred builder(s), and send them your orderflow exclusively.

Now that we know all the different ways in which we can send and share bundles, we're finally ready to [send a bundle](/flashbots-mev-share/searchers/sending-bundles).
