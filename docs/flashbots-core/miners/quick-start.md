For new mining pools who would like to receive Flashbots bundles, please complete the [Miner Indication of Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdz29fKXJXJFWXkEu8hZNG-NJUeAbOz0Jvw9mnNLskJHlMUDA/viewform).

The following steps are for mining pools already running Flashbots to receive v0.2 bundles:


**Stage I. Integration and Testing (May 17 - 23)**
* Step 1: Update MEV-geth node to the lastest version according to the [MEV-geth v0.2 spec](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth/releases/tag/v1.10.3-mev0.2.0), MEV-geth v0.2 reference implementation released on May 19

**Stage II. Receive Flashbots Bundles on v0.2 nodes (May 24 - 30)**
* Step 2: We will start sending Flashbots MEV bundles to the mining pools who have integrated with Flashbots Alpha v0.2.
* Step 3: Start migrating your hashrate to the Flashbots Alpha v0.2 nodes

:::tip reminder

Please continue to run your MEV-geth v0.2 pre-release node, while you set up a v0.2 full release node for testing.

:::


**Stage III. Complete switch to v0.2 nodes (May 31)**
* Step 4: v0.2 pre-release nodes can safely be shut down, leaving only the Flashbots Alpha v0.2 nodes.
