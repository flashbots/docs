title: interacting with mev-relay

## v0.1

In order to facilitate your interaction with MEV-Relay, we have created the mev-proxy repository as a simple example of a reserve proxy a miner can run to expose just the eth_sendBundle JSON-RPC method.

Access the mev-proxy repository [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-proxy).
