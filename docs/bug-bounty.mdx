# Bug bounty program

Flashbots is a research and development organization working on mitigating the negative externalities of current Maximal Extractable Value (from now on MEV) extraction techniques and avoiding the existential risks MEV could cause to state-rich blockchains like Ethereum.

## Tiers

<BugBounty severity="Low 🐛 " amount="5,000">

Criteria
- Low impact, medium likelihood
- Medium impact, low likelihood

Example
Attacker can sometimes put a node in a state that causes it to drop one out of every one hundred attestations made by a validator.

</BugBounty>


## Terms and Conditions

Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction. It falls under three goals: Democratizing Access to MEV Revenue, Bringing Transparency to MEV Activity, and Redistributing MEV Revenue.
