## Changelog

#### v0.6 Private transactions support
Added eth_sendPrivateTransaction support. Private transactions can be now accepted and included in the blocks. Such transactions are not distributed to any other nodes in the network and only taken into account when a block is constructed locally. 

#### v0.5 Immediate megabundle processing
Miners pick up megabundles immediately if they are better than the best known block so far.
It leads to significantly increased profitability (+50% MEV backtested).

#### v0.4 Megabundles support added
Relays can merge bundles and suggest them for profit switching.
Miners can define a list of trusted relay addresses from which megabundles are accepted.

#### v0.3 EIP-1559 support added
Bundle scoring takes into account BASEFEE mechanisms to calculate miner's revenue from bundles.

#### v0.2 `eth_sendBundle` RPC parameters change
The specification of the `eth_sendBundle` RPC is changing to support new features of v0.2. This change must be adopted by all searchers in order to be compatible with the v0.2 relay.

Scoring function does not change between v0.4 and v0.5:

$s$: bundle $U$ _score_ used to sort bundles.  
$U$: ordered list of transactions $T$ in a bundle.  
$M$: set of transactions $T$ in the mempool.  
$g_{T}$: _gas used_ by transaction $T$.  
$p_{T}$: _gas price_ of transaction $T$.  
$c_{T}$: _fee cap per gas_ of transaction $T$.  
$\delta_T$: _priority fee per gas_ of transaction $T$.  
$e_{T}$: _effective fee per gas_ of transaction $T$ equal $\min$($c_{T}$, BASEFEE + $\delta_T$).  
$m_{T}$: _miner fee per gas_ of transaction $T$ equal $e_{T}$ - BASEFEE.
