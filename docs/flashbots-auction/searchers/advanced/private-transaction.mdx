## How to send a single transaction to Flashbots

If you want to send a single transaction to flashbots, without sending it as a bundle, you can use the `sendPrivateTransaction` method.

This method has a few key advantages:

1. This method attempts to send your transaction to miners on every block for a maximum of 25 blocks. No need to listen for the next block and re-send yourself. Just call `result.wait()` and check the result.
2. Sending single transactions via this method is faster and more efficient than `sendBundle`. Transactions sent via this method are sent to our _bundler_, which creates bundles out of private transactions and sends them to miners. Ultimately, this means that your transaction will be mined sooner than if you were to send a single-transaction bundle with `sendBundle`.
3. Private transactions can be cancelled easily.

See [RPC endpoint](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint) for JSON-RPC definitions of the methods.

These methods are currently implemented in the [ethers-provider-flashbots-bundle](/flashbots-auction/searchers/libraries/ethers-js-provider) library. More languages coming soon.

if (waitRes === FlashbotsTransactionResolution.TransactionIncluded) {
    console.log("Private transaction successfully mined.")
} else if (waitRes === FlashbotsTransactionResolution.TransactionDropped) {
    console.log("Private transaction was not mined and has been removed from the system.")
}
```
