## How to send a single transaction to Flashbots

If you want to send a single transaction to flashbots, without sending it as a bundle, you can use the `sendPrivateTransaction` method.

This method attempts to send your transaction to miners on every block for a maximum of 25 blocks. No need to listen for the next block and re-send yourself. 

Private transactions can be cancelled with the `cancelPrivateTransaction` method. Once a transaction is submitted from the relay to a miner we cannot "recall" it. However, we can cancel submitting transactions for future blocks.

See [RPC endpoint](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint) for JSON-RPC definitions of the methods.

These methods are currently implemented in the [ethers-provider-flashbots-bundle](/flashbots-auction/searchers/libraries/ethers-js-provider) library. More languages coming soon.

}

const res = await flashbotsProvider.sendPrivateTransaction({
    transaction,
    signer,
}, {
    maxBlockNumber: (await provider.getBlockNumber()) + 5, // only allow tx to be mined for the next 5 blocks
});

const waitRes = await res.wait();
if (waitRes === FlashbotsTransactionResolution.TransactionIncluded) {
    console.log("Private transaction successfully mined.")
} else if (waitRes === FlashbotsTransactionResolution.TransactionDropped) {
    console.log("Private transaction was not mined and has been removed from the system.")
}
```
