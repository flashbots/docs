import Builders from '../../specs/mev-share/_builders.mdx';

Some users might want to send their transactions or bundles to multiple builders for various reasons. The ability to multiplex is supported by our APIs.

When you are using [`mev_sendBundle`](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint#mev_sendbundle) to send bundle, or [`eth_sendPrivateTransaction`](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_sendprivatetransaction) to send transaction, simply specify the builders you want to multiplex to in the `privacy.builders` parameter.

Below is the list of builders that you can multiplex to:
