## Block Builders

### Builder Fundamentals

**What is a Builder?**

Block builders are highly specialized actors who aggregate and construct blocks from transaction orderflow (bundles, private transactions, etc). 

**The Role of Builders**

Builders run algorithms and simulations (e.g. First Come First Serve, First Price Auctions, etc.) to order bundles and TXs in a block template (technically: *execution payload*) that maximizes profit. They then bid for and buy the validators’ blockspace, with the help of one or more relays, so their execution payloads are proposed to the blockchain.
