title: Flashbots Transparency Dashboard
---

The [Flashbots Transparency Dashboard](https://transparency.flashbots.net/) is a public dashboard of metrics related to the Realised Extractable Value (REV) on Ethereum and Flashbots Relays on MEV-boost - after the merge on September 15 2022. The dashboard shows the Ethereum mainnet data post-merge since block #15537940, and has 1 week freshness delay.

The Flashbots Transparency Dashboard is a key component of our commitment to maintaining transparency in our products and the wider MEV ecosystem. It serves as a valuable resource for contributors and collaborators, providing essential data for research purposes. We are dedicated to continually enhancing the dashboard by incorporating additional metrics as we gather more data.
