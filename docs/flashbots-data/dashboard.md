---

The [Flashbots Transparency Dashboard](https://transparency.flashbots.net/) is a public dashboard with metrics on Realised Extractable Value (REV) on Ethereum, as well as data related to the Flashbots MEV-Boost Relay. The dashboard includes data from the Ethereum mainnet since block #15537940 on September 15th 2022 and has a freshness delay of 1 week. Pre-merge MEV activity can be explored here: [MEV-Explore](https://explore.flashbots.net/).

The Transparency Dashboard is a key component of our commitment to provide transparency on the wider MEV ecosystem and our products. It serves as a valuable resource for contributors and collaborators by providing data for research. Methodology and more information can be found in the [forum post](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/will-the-real-mev-please-stand-up/1686) introducing the dashboard.
