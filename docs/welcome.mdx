## About Flashbots

Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and sustainable ecosystem for MEV, via a three-pronged approach:

- Illuminate: bringing transparency to MEV activity.
- Democratize: democratizing access to MEV revenue.
- Distribute: enabling sustainable distribution of MEV revenue.

Product & research are the semi-autonomous dual engines that propel our organization forward:

- [Flashbots Product](/) builds core infrastructure and ecosystem tooling that redefine the block production supply chain across blockchains.
- [Flashbots Research](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research) explores MEV market dynamics and blockchain design challenges at the intersection of economics, security, and cryptography.
