Flashbots Protect is a user-friendly, secure, and powerful way to transact on Ethereum for both novices and sophisticated users. 

It has the following key benefits:
- **Configurable:** you can choose which builders to send to and your mev-share settings.
- **Frontrunning protection:** your transaction will not be seen by hungry sandwich bots in the public mempool.
- **Get MEV back**: if your transaction creates MEV, you get up to 90% of it back through [MEV-Share](/flashbots-mev-share/overview).
- **No failed transactions:** your transaction will only be included if it doesn't include any reverts, so you don't pay for failed transactions.

There are three ways to use Flashbots Protect:
1. Add the Flashbots Protect RPC (`https://rpc.flashbots.net`) to your wallet. Most users will do this.
