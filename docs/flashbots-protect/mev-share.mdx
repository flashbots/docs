## Introduction

MEV-Share allows users to gain up to 90% of the MEV that their transactions create. By default, Protect users' transactions are sent to Flashbots [MEV-Share Node](/flashbots-mev-share/introduction), which returns them up to 90% of the MEV that their transactions create. By default, Protect users will be connected with the [Stable](/flashbots-protect/mev-share#stable-configuration) configuration, which is continuously tuned by Flashbots to optimize execution while protecting users from harmful MEV. This document guides users on the nuances and configurations of MEV-Share.

MEV-Share enables users to reclaim up to 90% of the MEV generated by their transactions. By default, transactions from Protect users are directed to the Flashbots [MEV-Share Node](/flashbots-mev-share/introduction), which facilitates this return. Users are automatically connected to the [Stable](/flashbots-protect/mev-share#stable-configuration) configuration, a setting continuously optimized by Flashbots to balance efficient execution and protection against harmful MEV. This document provides a guide on the mechanism and various configurations of MEV-Share.

Advanced users can exert more control over their transactions and preferences through the advanced panel or by manually configuring their Protect RPC request.

## Common configurations

### Stable Configuration

The Stable configuration is the default configuration for Protect RPC. No query parameters are specified to use it.

```url
https://rpc.flashbots.net
```

Currently, this configuration shares the following information:

- The `hash` of all transactions
- `default_logs` Partial logs (the pool id and the fact that a swap was made) for curve, balancer, and uniswapV2/V3-style trades
- Transactions are only forwarded to the Flashbots block builder

This may change over time as we gather more data and fine-tune the configuration to maximize benefits.

### Max Privacy

To use Protect with full privacy, set _only_ the `hash` hint in your Protect RPC URL:

```url
https://rpc.flashbots.net?hint=hash
```

This configuration ensures that all identifiable transaction data sent to the MEV-Share Node is concealed from searchers. However, it's important to note that this could make it more challenging for searchers to spot MEV opportunities, leading to a very likely decrease in your MEV kickback.

### Max Kickback

To use Protect with the maximum kickback, set _all_ hints in your Protect RPC URL:

```url
https://rpc.flashbots.net?hint=calldata&hint=contract_address&hint=function_selector&hint=logs&hint=hash
```

This configuration provides searchers with comprehensive details about your transaction, giving them better chance to identify more MEV opportunities and to return more MEV kickback to you.

## Examples

Here are some examples of configurations that you might choose, depending on your goals.

| <div style={{width:"180px"}}>Goal</div> | Flashbots Protect RPC URL |
| --- | --- |
| Stable | `https://rpc.flashbots.net` |
| Max Privacy | `https://rpc.flashbots.net?hint=hash` |
| Max Kickback | `https://rpc.flashbots.net/?hint=calldata&hint=contract_address&hint=function_selector&hint=logs&hint=hash` |
| Add Builders (share with other builders for faster inclusion) | `https://rpc.flashbots.net?builder=flashbots&builder=XYZ` |
| Change Refund (send more to validator for faster inclusion) | `https://rpc.flashbots.net?refund=userAddr:10` |

## Configuration Reference

The Protect RPC uses query parameters within the URL to convey your preferences. These parameters can include hints about your transaction, the builders to whom your transaction is directed, and the distribution of potential refunds if your transaction is bundled.

### Hints

To customize your hint setup, use the hint parameter to control the visibility of your transaction data to searchers. If no hints are provided, the default [Stable](/flashbots-protect/mev-share#stable-configuration) hint configuration will be used. If you specify one or more hints, any hint that is _not_ included will be disabled.

<HintsTable />

Here is an example:

```url
https://rpc.flashbots.net?hint=calldata&hint=logs&hint=hash
```

This configuration shares the calldata, logs, and hash of your transaction with searchers. It does not share the contract address or function selector.

### Builders

To designate the builders who will receive your transactions, use the `builder` parameter. This parameter can be repeated multiple times to include multiple builders. The builders listed below are currently supported.

<Builders />

It's important to understand that while adding more builders can increase your transaction inclusion rate, it also requires you to place trust in those builders. Here's an example of how to utilize the `builder` parameter:

```url
https://rpc.flashbots.net?builder=flashbots&builder=XYZ
```

This configuration sends your transaction to the Flashbots block builder and the XYZ block builder.

### Refunds

You can tailor your refund settings using the refund parameter. This determines the distribution of the searcher's payment among different addresses if your transaction is bundled. If not specified, the transaction originator (tx.origin) will by default receive 90% of the searcher's payment.

The refund parameter contains two colon-separated values: an address for the refund and the percentage of the searcher's payment to be refunded. To distribute the payment across multiple addresses, append a new refund parameter for each.

Here is an example of a refund parameter that sends 10% of the searcher's payment to the address `userAddr`:

```url
https://rpc.flashbots.net?refund=userAddr:10
```

All percentages in the refund parameters must total less than 100. The remaining percentage, inferred from 100 - total refund percentages, is the payment to the validator. Note that keeping a larger percentage of the refund may result in longer inclusion times, because it reduces the payment to the validator.
