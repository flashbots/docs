title: Rate Limits
---

In order to protect our services from abuse we have rate limits on the number of requests that can be made. Currently, the rate limits are set as follows.

## `rpc.flashbots.net` - Flashbots Protect RPC

| Method                                     | Limit             |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `eth_sendRawTransaction`                   | None              |
| `eth_call`                                 | 200 / IP / 5 min  |
| `eth_getTransactionReceipt`                | 200 / IP / 5 min  |
| `eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`  | 200 / IP / 5 min  |
| `eth_getBalance`                           | 200 / IP / 5 min  |
| All others                                 | 600 / IP / 5 min  |

Note that you are not required to read JSON RPC requests to send transactions to Flashbots Protect RPC.

Relay rate limits for advanced user bundles sent to `relay.flashbots.net` [can be found here](flashbots-mev-share/searchers/ratelimiting).

## Rate limiting exceptions

If you are a wallet or application integrating with protect and you require a higher rate limit please reach out to [Shea Ketsdever](https://twitter.com/SheaKetsdever).

## Batch request support

Flashbots Protect RPC is not supporting batch JSON-RPC requests.
