Flashbots Protect RPC allows regular users to easily submit their transactions to the Flashbots Auction by using a custom RPC endpoint in their wallet. Everything should be the same for users, except transactions are sent to the Flashbots builder instead of the public mempool.

Key benefits to using the Flashbots RPC endpoint:

- **Frontrunning protection:** your transaction will not be seen by hungry sandwich bots in the public mempool.
- **No failed transactions:** your transaction will only be included if it doesn't include any reverts, so you don't pay for failed transactions.
    > Note: your transaction could be uncled, emitted to the mempool, and then included on-chain.
- **Get MEV back**: if your transaction creates MEV, you get up to 90% of it back through [MEV-Share](/flashbots-mev-share/overview).

Privacy notice: **Flashbots Protect RPC does not track** any kind of user information (i.e. IP, location, etc.). No user information is ever stored or even logged.
