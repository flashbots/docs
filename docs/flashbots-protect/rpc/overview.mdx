Flashbots Protect makes it easy for anyone to protect themselves against frontrunning and sandwich attacks by routing transactions to the Flashbots Matchmaker, instead of the public mempool. The experience for the end user is the same as before, just with added benefits.

The major benefits of connecting to Flashbots Protect are:

- **Frontrunning protection:** transactions will not be seen by hungry sandwich bots in the public mempool.
- **No failed transactions:** transactions will only be included if it doesn't include any reverts, so users don't pay for failed transactions.
- **Etherscan integration:** users can see the status of their transactions on Etherscan.

## Key Considerations

Before you get started with Flashbots Protect here are a few things to be mindful of:
- You can find the status of your transaction on Etherscan. Etherscan has a great interface for viewing the status of your transaction from our status API.
- We will try to include your transaction for 6 minutes, after which point it is considered “expired” and will be dropped.
- Transactions under 42,000 gas, such as simple ETH transfers, do not need front-running protection, so they are sent to the public mempool to provide the fastest execution possible.
- Transactions that perform simple actions - such as token approvals or transfers - will also be sent to the public mempool as these do not need frontrunning protection.
- Your transactions can be emitted to the public mempool if you switch RPC endpoints from Flashbots Protect RPC to another RPC while your transactions are pending.


Privacy notice: **Flashbots Protect does not track** any kind of user information (i.e. IP, location, etc.). No user information is ever stored or even logged.

We intend to release more features on top of Flashbots Protect as part of MEV-Share, offering even more powerful functionalities.

We want to thank MiningDAO, mistX and Nethermind for significant code contributions, testing, and being early adopters of Flashbots Protect.
