Flashbots Protect users' transactions automatically flow to the Flashbots [Matchmaker](/flashbots-mev-share/overview#what-is-a-matchmaker), which returns them up to 90% of the MEV that their transactions create. By default, users connected to Protect will be connected with the [Stable](/flashbots-protect/rpc/mev-share#stable-configuration) configuration, which is continuously tuned by Flashbots to optimize execution while protecting users from harmful MEV.

MEV-Share users on Flashbots Protect can directly control which parts of their transaction they wish to share with searchers. Sharing less data will improve privacy, while sharing more will improve chances of both having their transactions included quickly and receiving MEV kickbacks.

## Protect RPC Reference

Preferences are passed as query params in the Protect RPC URL. Users can specify which hints to share about their transactions; which builders to send their transactions to; and how to distribute any refunds if their transaction is bundled.

Transactions sent to Flashbots Protect are automatically forwarded to the Flashbots Matchmaker with the [Stable](/flashbots-protect/rpc/mev-share#stable-configuration) configuration, which maintains user privacy while optimizing transaction execution. Users do not need to do anything to start benefiting from MEV-Share right away, other than connect their wallet to Flashbots Protect.

To use a custom hint configuration, `hint` can be specified multiple times to specify exactly which data from the user's transactions is shared with searchers. If no hints are specified, the default [Stable](/flashbots-protect/rpc/mev-share#stable-configuration) hint configuration is used. If one or more hint is specified, any hint _not_ specified is disabled.

To specify which builders will receive your transactions, the `builder` parameter can be specified multiple times.

To use a custom refund configuration, `refund` can be specified multiple times to indicate what address(es) should receive what percentage(s) of the payment from a searcher who bundles the user's transaction. If no hints are specified, 90% of any searcher payment will be refunded to `tx.origin` of the user's transaction.

### Refunds

The _refund_ param contains two values separated by a colon `:`. The first value is the address that the refund should be transferred to. The second value is the percentage of the searcher's payment that should be refunded. To split the payment across multiple addresses, add a new _refund_ param for each address with the amount that it should receive.

The sum of all percentages specified in _refund_ params must be less than 100. The validator payment is inferred from `100 - sum of refund percentages`. Note that keeping a larger percentage of the refund may result in longer inclusion times, because it reduces the payment to the validator.

### Stable Configuration

The Stable configuration is the default configuration for Protect RPC -- no hints are specified to use it.

```txt
https://rpc.flashbots.net
```

> :information_source: The Stable configuration currently shares the `hash` from users' transactions. It also shares partial logs (the pool id and the fact that a swap was made) for curve, balancer, and uniswapV2/V3-style trades. This may change over time as we gather more data and fine-tune the configuration to maximize benefits for our users.

### Full Privacy

To use Protect with full privacy, set _only_ the `hash` hint in your Protect RPC URL:

```txt
https://rpc.flashbots.net?hint=hash
```

This will completely hide all identifying transaction data sent to the Matchmaker from searchers. Transaction hashes cannot be used to gain any information about a transaction or its origin.
