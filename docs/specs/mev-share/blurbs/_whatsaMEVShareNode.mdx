A MEV-Share Node is a service that matches user transactions with searcher bundles. Flashbots runs MEV-Share Nodes on Ethereum Mainnet and Goerli. Users submit their transactions to the Node, which shares select information about transactions with searchers. Searchers propose transactions for the Node to bundle with the user transactions (currently we only support backruns). The Node forwards these bundles to a block builder with a requirement that **the user is paid a refund**; a percentage of the winning searcher's bundle profit.
