MEV-Share is an open-source protocol, not a company. It uses privacy and commitments to facilitate permissionless collaboration between users/orderflow-providers and searchers. It is credibly neutral, permissionless for searchers, and does not enshrine a single block builder. Aggregating order flow to MEV-Share will greatly reduce proprietary order flow as a centralizing force on Ethereum while enabling wallets and other sources of order flow to participate in the MEV supply chain.
