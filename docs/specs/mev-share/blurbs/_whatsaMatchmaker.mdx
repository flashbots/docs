A matchmaker is a service that matches user transactions with searcher bundles. Flashbots runs matchmakers on Ethereum Mainnet and Goerli. Users submit their transactions to the matchmaker, which shares select information about transactions with searchers. Searchers propose transactions for the matchmaker to bundle with the user transactions (currently we only support backruns). The matchmaker forwards these bundles to a block builder with a requirement that **the user is paid a kickback**; a percentage of the winning searcher's bundle profit.
